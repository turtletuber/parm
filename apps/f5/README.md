### F5
F5 started out as a multiplayer, player-built choose your own online text adventure.

I wrote code to support different hosting different types of text adventures with only the one codebase. For instance, you could create a live config that would define a "one word story" text adventure. This would be deployed along with any other configurations on each deploy.

The one word story almost served like a blog and before I knew it, I was using f5 to serve my blog.

Since then, I've mostly abandoned the text adventure apps (though they still work to my knowledge).

Now the focus is building out this blog. It has very strange patterns. Here are the key features:
* you can define values in the live config which are then bundled with the app at build time
* you can define build-time file overrides by appending your app name to any existing file in the codebase
* you can add whitelisted React components to your markdown in blog posts and they will render correctly

It's been an interesting experiment. I will continue to simply use this as a playground for proofing React components and hosting random tools or widgets I build.

### F5

F5 is a massive multiplayer online text adventure.

The multiplayer component is that if you reach the end of the "adventure" by following a certain path you have to wait for someone else to add the next part of the story, but currently that's not enforced. Once someone replies, the adventure continues.

### Play it
https://parm.app/

### Development
```sh
# fetch code and start dev server
git clone https://github.com/prmichaelsen/parm.git
npm i && npm i -g @nrwl/cli
# fill this with the requisite secrets
touch ./env/parm-app.json
nx serve f5
```
You'll need some secrets, reach out to me if you want to run this locally and I can work with you.

## Deployment
To deploy all f5 apps:
```sh
# *requires npm i -g typescript ts-node
./tools/scripts/f5/deploy.ts
```

This script:
* pulls the live config for each app from firestore
* bundles the apps
* updates the dist with some assets
* deploys to firebase hosting

### Key
This key is allows me to label roadmap items. Not everything will be assigned labels.

If I provide two keys for one category, it means its somewhere inbetween.

* 🟢🟡🔴 -  urgency, 🔴 being the most urgent
* 0️⃣3️⃣6️⃣9️⃣ -  most important, 9️⃣ being the most imporant, 0️⃣ being optional
* ✨🐞 - feature, bug

### FAQ

#### What if someone tries to make every option "you died"? That's no fun.
No that's fine. It's a build your-own-adventure. I'm not going to make up any rules about how you should play _your_ adventure. Anything can happen in the adventure. So your character died. What happens next?

### Design
#### Option Selection Design
The plan is to eventually intelligently select which options to display based on some criteria
such as
* longest path
* newest
* most travelled

> Open Question: which selection criteria not mentioned here would help enrich the gaming experience?
